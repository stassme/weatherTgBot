/**
 * Negotiates the languages between the list of requested locales against
 * a list of available locales.
 *
 * The algorithm is based on the BCP4647 3.3.2 Extended Filtering algorithm,
 * with several modifications:
 *
 *  1) available locales are treated as ranges
 *
 *    This change allows us to match a more specific request against
 *    more generic available locale.
 *
 *    For example, if the available locale list provides locale `en`,
 *    and the requested locale is `en-US`, we treat the available locale as
 *    a locale that matches all possible english requests.
 *
 *    This means that we expect available locale ID to be as precize as
 *    the matches they want to cover.
 *
 *    For example, if there is only `sr` available, it's ok to list
 *    it in available locales. But once the available locales has both,
 *    Cyrl and Latn variants, the locale IDs should be `sr-Cyrl` and `sr-Latn`
 *    to avoid any `sr-*` request to match against whole `sr` range.
 *
 *    What it does ([requested] * [available] = [supported]):
 *
 *    ['en-US'] * ['en'] = ['en']
 *
 *  2) likely subtags from LDML 4.3 Likely Subtags has been added
 *
 *    The most obvious likely subtag that can be computed is a duplication
 *    of the language field onto region field (`fr` => `fr-FR`).
 *
 *    On top of that, likely subtags may use a list of mappings, that
 *    allow the algorithm to handle non-obvious matches.
 *    For example, making sure that we match `en` to `en-US` or `sr` to
 *    `sr-Cyrl`, while `sr-RU` to `sr-Latn-RU`.
 *
 *    This list can be taken directly from CLDR Supplemental Data.
 *
 *    What it does ([requested] * [available] = [supported]):
 *
 *    ['fr'] * ['fr-FR'] = ['fr-FR']
 *    ['en'] * ['en-US'] = ['en-US']
 *    ['sr'] * ['sr-Latn', 'sr-Cyrl'] = ['sr-Cyrl']
 *
 *  3) variant/region range check has been added
 *
 *    Lastly, the last form of check is against the requested locale ID
 *    but with the variant/region field replaced with a `*` range.
 *
 *    The rationale here laid out in LDML 4.4 Language Matching:
 *      "(...) normally the fall-off between the user's languages is
 *      substantially greated than regional variants."
 *
 *    In other words, if we can't match for the given region, maybe
 *    we can match for the same language/script but other region, and
 *    it will in most cases be preferred over falling back on the next
 *    language.
 *
 *    What it does ([requested] * [available] = [supported]):
 *
 *    ['en-AU'] * ['en-US'] = ['en-US']
 *    ['sr-RU'] * ['sr-Latn-RO'] = ['sr-Latn-RO'] // sr-RU -> sr-Latn-RU
 *
 *    It works similarly to getParentLocales algo, except that we stop
 *    after matching against variant/region ranges and don't try to match
 *    ignoring script ranges. That means that `sr-Cyrl` will never match
 *    against `sr-Latn`.
